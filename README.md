Raster Vision is an open source Python framework for building computer vision models on satellite, aerial, and other large imagery sets (including oblique drone imagery).
* It allows users (who don't need to be experts in deep learning!) to quickly and repeatably configure experiments that execute a machine learning pipeline including: analyzing training data, creating training chips, training models, creating predictions, evaluating models, and bundling the model files and configuration for easy deployment.
![Overview of Raster Vision workflow](docs/img/rv-pipeline-overview.png)
* There is built-in support for chip classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation with backends using PyTorch.
![Examples of chip classification, object detection and semantic segmentation](docs/img/cv-tasks.png)
* Experiments can be executed on CPUs and GPUs with built-in support for running in the cloud using [AWS Batch](https://github.com/azavea/raster-vision-aws).
* The framework is extensible to new data sources, tasks (eg. instance segmentation), backends (eg. Detectron2), and cloud providers.

See the [documentation](https://docs.rastervision.io) for more details.

### Setup

There are several ways to setup Raster Vision:
* To build Docker images from scratch, after cloning this repo, run `docker/build`, and run the container using `docker/run`.
* Docker images are published to [quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/azavea/raster-vision). The tag for the `raster-vision` image determines what type of image it is:
    - The `pytorch-*` tags are for running the PyTorch containers.
    - We publish a new tag per merge into `master`, which is tagged with the first 7 characters of the commit hash. To use the latest version, pull the `latest` suffix, e.g. `raster-vision:pytorch-latest`. Git tags are also published, with the Github tag name as the Docker tag suffix.
* Raster Vision can be installed directly using `pip install rastervision`. However, some of its dependencies will have to be installed manually.

For more detailed instructions, see the [Setup docs](https://docs.rastervision.io/en/0.13/setup.html).

### Example

The best way to get a feel for what Raster Vision enables is to look at an example of how to configure and run an experiment. Experiments are configured using a fluent builder pattern that makes configuration easy to read, reuse and maintain.

```python
# tiny_spacenet.py

from rastervision.core.rv_pipeline import *
from rastervision.core.backend import *
from rastervision.core.data import *
from rastervision.pytorch_backend import *
from rastervision.pytorch_learner import *

    root_uri = '/opt/data/output/'

    train_image_uri = f'{base_uri}/RGB-PanSharpen_AOI_2_Vegas_img205.tif'

    val_image_uri = f'{base_uri}/RGB-PanSharpen_AOI_2_Vegas_img25.tif'
    val_label_uri = f'{base_uri}/buildings_AOI_2_Vegas_img25.geojson'

    channel_order = [0, 1, 2]
    class_config = ClassConfig(
        names=['building', 'background'], colors=['red', 'black'])

    def make_scene(scene_id: str, image_uri: str,
                   label_uri: str) -> SceneConfig:
        """
        - The GeoJSON does not have a class_id property for each geom,
          so it is inferred as 0 (ie. building) because the default_class_id
          is set to 0.
        - The labels are in the form of GeoJSON which needs to be rasterized
          to use as label for semantic segmentation, so we use a RasterizedSource.
        - The rasterizer set the background (as opposed to foreground) pixels
          to 1 because background_class_id is set to 1.
        """
        raster_source = RasterioSourceConfig(
            uris=[image_uri], channel_order=channel_order)
        vector_source = GeoJSONVectorSourceConfig(
            uri=label_uri, default_class_id=0, ignore_crs_field=True)

            raster_source=RasterizedSourceConfig(
                vector_source=vector_source,
                rasterizer_config=RasterizerConfig(background_class_id=1)))
        return SceneConfig(
            id=scene_id,

        train_scenes=[

        ],
        validation_scenes=[
            make_scene('scene_25', val_image_uri, val_label_uri)
        ])

    # Use the PyTorch backend for the SemanticSegmentation pipeline.
    chip_sz = 300

    backend = PyTorchSemanticSegmentationConfig(
        data=SemanticSegmentationGeoDataConfig(
            scene_dataset=scene_dataset,
            window_opts=GeoDataWindowConfig(
                method=GeoDataWindowMethod.random,
                size=chip_sz,
                size_lims=(chip_sz, chip_sz + 1),
                max_windows=10)),
        model=SemanticSegmentationModelConfig(backbone=Backbone.resnet50),
        solver=SolverConfig(lr=1e-4, num_epochs=1, batch_sz=2))

    return SemanticSegmentationConfig(

        dataset=scene_dataset,
        backend=backend,
        train_chip_sz=chip_sz,
        predict_chip_sz=chip_sz)

```

Raster Vision uses a unittest-like method for executing experiments. For instance, if the above was defined in `tiny_spacenet.py`, with the proper setup you could run the experiment using:

```bash
> rastervision run local tiny_spacenet.py
```

See the [Quickstart](https://docs.rastervision.io/en/0.13/quickstart.html) for a more complete description of running this example.
