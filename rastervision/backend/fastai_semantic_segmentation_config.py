        """Set options for training models.

        Args:
            batch_size: (int) the batch size
            weight_decay: (float) the weight decay
            lr: (float or None) the learning rate if using a fixed LR
                (ie. one_cycle is False),
                or the maximum LR to use if one_cycle is True,
                or None if automatic learning rate finder (fastai lr_find)
                should be used
            one_cycle: (bool) True if fastai fit_one_cycle should be used. This
                cycles the LR once during the course of training and seems to
                result in a pretty consistent improvement. See lr for more
                details.
            num_epochs: (int) number of epochs (sweeps through training set) to
                train model for
            model_arch: (str) classification model backbone to use for UNet
                architecture. Any option in torchvision.models is valid, for
                example, resnet18.
            mixed_prec: (bool) use mixed-precision training. Ideally, this will
                make things run ~2x fast if GPU supports half-precision training
                (such as on Tesla V100). All arrays should be divisible by
                8 to maximize speed gains.
                See https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/sdk/mixed-precision-training/index.html # noqa
            flip_vert: (bool) use vertical flips and rotations for data aug
            sync_interval: (int) sync training directory to cloud every
                sync_interval epochs.
            debug: (bool) if True, save debug chips (ie. visualizations of
                input to model during training) during training and use
                single-core for creating minibatches.
            train_prop: (float) number between 0 and 1 that controls what
                proportion of the training set is used for training
            train_count: (int) number of training examples to use during
                training
            log_tensorboard: (bool) if True, write events to Tensorboard log
                file
            run_tensorboard: (bool) if True, run a Tensorboard server at
                port 6006 that uses the logs generated by the log_tensorboard
                option
            tta: (bool) if True, use test-time augmentation. This will make
                a prediction for 8 flips/rotations of the image and then
                average them together. Should result in small improvement in
                accuracy, but 8x slowdown.
            oversample: (dict or None) of form
                {'rare_class_ids': <list of class ids>, 'rare_target_prop': <float>}
                This will make it so chips containing any labels in rare_class_ids
                will be sampled with a probability of rare_target_prop. This is
                to help cope with severely imbalanced datasets.
