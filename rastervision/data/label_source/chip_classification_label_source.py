    """Infer the class_id of a cell given a set of polygons.

    Given a cell and a set of polygons, the problem is to infer the class_id
    that best captures the content of the cell. This is non-trivial since there
    can be multiple polygons of differing classes overlapping with the cell.
    Any polygons that sufficiently overlaps with the cell are in the running for
    setting the class_id. If there are none in the running, the cell is either
    considered null or background. See args for more details.

    Args:
        cell: Box
        str_tree: (STRtree) collection of geoms in scene used for geometric queries.
            The geoms need to have class_id monkey-patched onto them.
        ioa_thresh: (float) the minimum IOA of a polygon and cell for that
            polygon to be a candidate for setting the class_id
        use_intersection_over_cell: (bool) If true, then use the area of the
            cell as the denominator in the IOA. Otherwise, use the area of the
            polygon.
        background_class_id: (None or int) If not None, class_id to use as the
            background class; ie. the one that is used when a window contains
            no boxes. If not set, empty windows have None set as their class_id
            which is considered a null value.
        pick_min_class_id: If true, the class_id for a cell is the minimum
            class_id of the boxes in that cell. Otherwise, pick the class_id of
            the box covering the greatest area.
