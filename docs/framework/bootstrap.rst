Bootstrap new projects with a template
======================================

When using Raster Vision on a new project, the best practice is to create a new repo with its own Docker image based on the Raster Vision image. This involves a fair amount of boilerplate code which has a few things that vary between projects. To facilitate bootstrapping new projects, there is a `cookiecutter <https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/>`_ `template <{{ repo }}/cookiecutter_template>`_. Assuming that you cloned the Raster Vision repo and ran ``pip install cookiecutter``, you can instantiate the template as follows (after adjusting paths appropriately for your particular setup).

.. code-block:: console

    [lfishgold@monoshone ~/projects]
    $ cookiecutter raster-vision/cookiecutter_template/
    caps_project_name [MY_PROJECT]:
    project_name [my_project]:
    docker_image [my_project]:
    parent_docker_image [quay.io/azavea/raster-vision:pytorch-{{ version }}]:

The output is a repo structure with the skeleton of a Raster Vision plugin that can be pip installed, and everything needed to build, run, and publish a Docker image with the plugin. The resulting ``README.md`` file contains setup and usage information for running locally and on Batch, which makes use of the :ref:`CloudFormation setup <cloudformation jobdefs>` for creating new user/project-specific job defs.
