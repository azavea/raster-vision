v0.30 to v0.31
==============


* You will need to have ``pydantic>=2`` installed.
* :class:`.StatsTransformer` no longer applies ``channel_order`` to the stats. The stats are now expected to already be in the same order as the channels in the output of the ``RasterSource``.

  * Backward compatibility has been maintained for older model-bundles, so they should work as before without modification.

* Default padding behavior has changed. See `SlidingWindowGeoDataset <https://docs.rastervision.io/en/0.31/usage/tutorials/sampling_training_data.html#SlidingWindowGeoDataset>`_.
* You no longer need to manually figure out the right padding value to use when using ``crop_sz`` during prediction. It is determined automatically such that no pixels around the edges are left out.
* ``force_same_dtype`` has been removed from :class:`.MultiRasterSource` and :class:`.MultiRasterSourceConfig`. Sub-raster sources are now always expected to have the same ``dtype``.
* ``max_windows`` is now a required argument in :class:`.RandomWindowGeoDataset`.
