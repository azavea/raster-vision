.. _raster vision config:

Configuration
=============

Raster Vision is configured via the `everett <https://everett.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ library, and will look for configuration in the following locations, in this order:

* Environment Variables
* A ``.env`` file in the working directory that holds environment variables.
* Raster Vision INI configuration files

By default, Raster Vision looks for a configuration file named ``default`` in the ``${HOME}/.rastervision`` folder.

Profiles
--------

Profiles allow you to specify profile names from the command line or environment variables
to determine which settings to use. The configuration file used will be named the same as the
profile: if you had two profiles (the ``default`` and one named ``myprofile``), your
``${HOME}/.rastervision`` would look like this:

.. code-block:: console

    > ls ~/.rastervision
    default    myprofile

Use the ``rastervision --profile`` option in the :ref:`cli` to set the profile.

Configuration-file Sections
---------------------------

.. _s3 config:

``AWS_S3``
~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: ini

   [AWS_S3]
   requester_pays = False

* ``requester_pays`` - Set to True if you would like to allow using `requester pays <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/RequesterPaysBuckets.html>`_ S3 buckets. The default value is False.

``BATCH``
~~~~~~~~~

See :ref:`aws batch setup`.

``SAGEMAKER``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See :ref:`aws sagemaker setup`.

Environment Variables
---------------------

Any profile file option can also be stated in the environment. Just prepend the section name to the setting name, e.g. ``export AWS_S3_REQUESTER_PAYS="False"``.

In addition to those environment variables that match the INI file values, there are the following environment variable options:

* ``TMPDIR`` - Setting this environment variable will cause all temporary directories to be created inside this folder. This is useful, for example, when you have a Docker container setup that mounts large network storage into a specific directory inside the Docker container. The tmp_dir can also be set on :ref:`cli` as a root option.
* ``RV_CONFIG`` - Optional path to the specific Raster Vision Configuration file. These configurations will override  configurations that exist in configurations files in the default locations, but will not cause those configurations to be ignored.
* ``RV_CONFIG_DIR`` - Optional path to the directory that contains Raster Vision configuration. Defaults to ``${HOME}/.rastervision``
