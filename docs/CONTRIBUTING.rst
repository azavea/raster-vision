Contributing
============

We are happy to take contributions! It is best to get in touch with the maintainers
about larger features or design changes *before* starting the work,
as it will make the process of accepting changes smoother.

Everyone who contributes code to Raster Vision will be asked to sign the
Azavea CLA, which is based off of the Apache CLA.

1. Download a copy of the [Raster Vision Individual Contributor License
   Agreement](docs/cla/2018_04_17-Raster-Vision-Open-Source-Contributor-Agreement-Individual.pdf)
   or the [Raster Vision Corporate Contributor License
   Agreement](docs/cla/2018_04_18-Raster-Vision-Open-Source-Contributor-Agreement-Corporate.pdf)

2. Print out the CLAs and sign them, or use PDF software that allows placement of a signature image.

3. Send the CLAs to Azavea by one of:
