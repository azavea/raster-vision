Raster Vision 0.30
------------------

This release brings exciting new functionality and major usability improvements to Raster Vision. 

Highlights
~~~~~~~~~~

- **Easier installation:** Raster Vision no longer requires exact versions of dependencies, which means it can more easily be installed alongside other packages!
- **AWS SageMaker support:** you can now run Raster Vision jobs on SageMaker via

  .. code-block:: python

    rastervision run sagemaker ...
  
  You can even run training over multiple instances with multiple GPUs! See :ref:`aws sagemaker setup` for more details.
- **Distributed training support:** Raster Vision ``Learners`` now support distributed training (both multi-node and multi-GPU) via `PyTorch DDP <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/ddp.html>`__. If your machine has multiple GPUs, Raster Vision will now automatically use them all during training.
- **New CLI command**, :ref:`cli predict_scene`, that allows greater configurability than the ``predict`` command.

  .. code-block:: python

    rastervision predict_scene <model_bundle_uri> <scene_config_uri> [--predict_options_uri <predict_options_uri>]
- **New tutorial:** :doc:`usage/tutorials/onnx_inference`.

API changes
~~~~~~~~~~~

This release makes a number of breaking changes; however, it should still be backward compatible with older model-bundles. See the :doc:`migration guide <migration/v0-21_to_v0-30>` for more details.

Raster Vision 0.21
------------------

This release brings some exciting new functionality to Raster Vision. 

Highlights:

- Raster Vision can now consume imagery from STAC APIs via the newly-added :class:`.XarraySource` (see tutorial: :doc:`usage/tutorials/stac_plus_osm`).
- Raster Vision can now consume temporal data i.e. time series of images via :class:`.TemporalMultiRasterSource` and :class:`.XarraySource` (see tutorial: :doc:`usage/tutorials/temporal`).
- The model-bundles produced by now additionally include the model exported in the ONNX format and Raster Vision will use an ONNX runtime to make predictions if ``RASTERVISION_USE_ONNX=1`` is set.

API changes:

- To crop the extent of a :class:`.RasterSource` (or :class:`.LabelSource`), you now have to specify ``bbox`` instead of ``extent``. The term "extent", as used in the codebase, has also been redefined to always be the box ``Box(0, 0, height, width)``, where ``height`` and ``width`` are the height and width of the ``bbox``.
- :class:`.GeoJSONVectorSource` can now take a list of URIs, allowing geometries to be read from multiple files.
- :class:`.VectorOutputConfig` (and subclasses) no longer require ``uri`` to be specified.

Features

Raster Vision 0.20
------------------

This release brings major improvements to Raster Vision's **usability** as well as its **usefulness**.

Whereas previously Raster Vision was a **framework** where users could configure a *pipeline* and then let it run, it is now *also* a **library** from which users can pick individual components and use them to build new things.

We have also significantly improved the documentation. Most notably, it now contains detailed :doc:`tutorial notebooks <usage/tutorials/index>` as well a full :doc:`API reference <api_reference/index>`. The documentation for the Raster Vision pipeline, which used to make up most of the documentation in previous versions, is now located in the :doc:`framework/index` section.

In terms of features, some highlights are:

- Support for multiband imagery, introduced in v0.13 for semantic segmentation, is now also available for chip classification and object detection. (`#1345 <https://github.com/azavea/raster-vision/pull/1345>`__)
- Improved data fusion: the :class:`~rastervision.core.data.raster_source.multi_raster_source.MultiRasterSource` can now combine :class:`RasterSources <rastervision.core.data.raster_source.raster_source.RasterSource>` with varying extents and resolutions. (`#1308 <https://github.com/azavea/raster-vision/pull/1308>`__)
- You can now discard edges of predicted chips in semantic segmentation in order to reduce boundary artifacts (`#1486 <https://github.com/azavea/raster-vision/pull/1486>`__). This can be used *in addition* to the `previously introduced <https://github.com/azavea/raster-vision/pull/1057>`__ ability to average overlapping regions in adjacent chips.
- Progress-bars will now be shown for all downloads and uploads as well as other time-consuming operations that take longer than 5 seconds.
- Improved caching of downloads: Raster Vision can now cache downloads. Also a bug that caused Raster Vision to download the same image multiple times has been fixed, resulting in significant speedups.

.. warning:: This release breaks backward-compatibility with previous versions.

~~~~~~~~

- Extend multiband support to all tasks (`#1345 <https://github.com/azavea/raster-vision/pull/1345>`__)

Raster Vision 0.13.1
--------------------

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

* Fix image plot by adding default plot transform `#1144 <https://github.com/azavea/raster-vision/pull/1144>`__

Raster Vision 0.13
------------------

This release presents a major jump in Raster Vision's power and flexibility. The most significant changes are:

Support arbitrary models and loss functions (`#985 <https://github.com/azavea/raster-vision/pull/985>`__, `#992 <https://github.com/azavea/raster-vision/pull/992>`__)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Raster Vision is no longer restricted to using the built in models and loss functions. It is now possible to import models and loss functions from a GitHub repo or a URI or a zip file as long as they interface correctly with RV's learner code. This means that you can now easily swap models in your existing training pipelines, allowing you to take advantage of the latest models or to make customizations that help with your specific task; all with minimal changes.

This is made possible by PyTorch's ``hub`` module.

Currently not supported for Object Detection.

Support for multiband images (even with Transfer Learning) (`#972 <https://github.com/azavea/raster-vision/pull/972>`__)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is now possible to train on imagery with more than 3 channels. Raster Vision automatically modifies the model to be able to accept more than 3 channels. If using pretrained models, the pre-learned weights are retained.

The model modification cannot be performed automatically when using an external model. But as long as the external model supports multiband inputs, it will work correctly with RV.

Currently only supported for Semantic Segmentation.

Support for reading directly from raster sources during training without chipping (`#1046 <https://github.com/azavea/raster-vision/pull/1046>`__)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is no longer necessary to go through a ``chip`` stage to produce a training dataset. You can instead provide the ``DatasetConfig`` directly to the PyTorch backend and RV will sample training chips on the fly during training. All the examples now use this as the default. Check them out to see how to use this feature.

Support for arbitrary Albumentations transforms (`#1001 <https://github.com/azavea/raster-vision/pull/1001>`__)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is now possible to supply an arbitrarily complicated Albumentations transform for data augmentation. In the ``DataConfig`` subclasses, you can specify a ``base_transform`` that is applied every time (i.e. in training, validation, and prediction), an ``aug_transform`` that is only applied during training, and a ``plot_transform`` (via ``PlotOptions``) to ensure that sample images are plotted correctly (e.g. use ``plot_transform`` to rescale a normalized image to 0-1).

Allow streaming reads from Rasterio sources (`#1020 <https://github.com/azavea/raster-vision/pull/1020>`__)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is now possible to stream chips from a remote ``RasterioSource`` without first downloading the entire file. To enable, set ``allow_streaming=True`` in the ``RasterioSourceConfig``.

Analyze stage no longer necessary when using non-uint8 rasters (`#972 <https://github.com/azavea/raster-vision/pull/972>`__)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is no longer necessary to go through an ``analyze`` stage to be able to convert non-``uint8`` rasters to ``uint8`` chips. Chips can now be stored as ``numpy`` arrays, and will be normalized to ``float`` during training/prediction based on their specific data type. See ``spacenet_vegas.py`` for example usage.

Currently only supported for Semantic Segmentation.

Raster Vision 0.12
------------------

This release presents a major refactoring of Raster Vision intended to simplify the codebase, and make it more flexible and customizable.

To learn about how to upgrade existing experiment configurations, perhaps the best approach is to read the `source code <https://github.com/azavea/raster-vision/tree/0.12/rastervision_pytorch_backend/rastervision/pytorch_backend/examples>`__ of the :ref:`rv examples` to get a feel for the new syntax. Unfortunately, existing predict packages will not be usable with this release, and upgrading and re-running the experiments will be necessary. For more advanced users who have written plugins or custom commands, the internals have changed substantially, and we recommend reading :ref:`architecture`.

Since the changes in this release are sweeping, it is difficult to enumerate a list of all changes and associated PRs. Therefore, this change log describes the changes at a high level, along with some justifications and pointers to further documentation.

Simplified Configuration Schema
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We are still using a modular, programmatic approach to configuration, but have switched to using a ``Config`` base class which uses the `Pydantic <https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/>`__ library. This allows us to define configuration schemas in a declarative fashion, and let the underlying library handle serialization, deserialization, and validation. In addition, this has allowed us to `DRY <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself>`__ up the configuration code, eliminate the use of Protobufs, and represent configuration from plugins in the same fashion as built-in functionality. To see the difference, compare the configuration code for ``ChipClassificationLabelSource`` in 0.11 (`label_source.proto <https://github.com/azavea/raster-vision/blob/0.11/rastervision/protos/label_source.proto>`__ and `chip_classification_label_source_config.py <https://github.com/azavea/raster-vision/blob/0.11/rastervision/data/label_source/chip_classification_label_source_config.py>`__), and in 0.12 (`chip_classification_label_source_config.py <https://github.com/azavea/raster-vision/blob/0.12/rastervision_core/rastervision/core/data/label_source/chip_classification_label_source_config.py>`__).

Abstracted out Pipelines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Raster Vision includes functionality for running computational pipelines in local and remote environments, but previously, this functionality was tightly coupled with the "domain logic" of machine learning on geospatial data in the ``Experiment`` abstraction. This made it more difficult to add and modify commands, as well as use this functionality in other projects. In this release, we factored out the experiment running code into a separate :ref:`rastervision.pipeline <pipelines plugins>` package, which can be used for defining, configuring, customizing, and running arbitrary computational pipelines.

Reorganization into Plugins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The rest of Raster Vision is now written as a set of optional plugins that have  ``Pipelines`` which implement the "domain logic" of machine learning on geospatial data. Implementing everything as optional (``pip`` installable) plugins makes it easier to install subsets of Raster Vision functionality, eliminates separate code paths for built-in and plugin functionality, and provides (de facto) examples of how to write plugins. See :ref:`codebase overview` for more details.

More Flexible PyTorch Backends
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The 0.10 release added PyTorch backends for chip classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection. In this release, we abstracted out the common code for training models into a flexible ``Learner`` base class with subclasses for each of the computer vision tasks. This code is in the ``rastervision.pytorch_learner`` plugin, and is used by the ``Backends`` in ``rastervision.pytorch_backend``. By decoupling ``Backends`` and ``Learners``, it is now easier to write arbitrary ``Pipelines`` and new ``Backends`` that reuse the core model training code, which can be customized by overriding methods such as ``build_model``. See :ref:`customizing rv`.

Removed Tensorflow Backends
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Tensorflow backends and associated Docker images have been removed. It is too difficult to maintain backends for multiple deep learning frameworks, and PyTorch has worked well for us. Of course, it's still possible to write ``Backend`` plugins using any framework.

Other Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* For simplicity, we moved the contents of the `raster-vision-examples <https://github.com/azavea/raster-vision-examples>`__ and `raster-vision-aws <https://github.com/azavea/raster-vision-aws>`__ repos into the main repo. See :ref:`rv examples` and :ref:`cloudformation setup`.
* To help people bootstrap new projects using RV, we added :ref:`bootstrap`.
* All the PyTorch backends now offer data augmentation using `albumentations <https://albumentations.readthedocs.io/>`__.
* We removed the ability to automatically skip running commands that already have output, "tree workflows", and "default providers". We also unified the ``Experiment``, ``Command``, and ``Task`` classes into a single ``Pipeline`` class which is subclassed for different computer vision (or other) tasks. These features and concepts had little utility in our experience, and presented stumbling blocks to outside contributors and plugin writers.
* Although it's still possible to add new ``VectorSources`` and other classes for reading data, our philosophy going forward is to prefer writing pre-processing scripts to get data into the format that Raster Vision can already consume. The ``VectorTileVectorSource`` was removed since it violates this new philosophy.
* We previously attempted to make predictions for semantic segmentation work in a streaming fashion (to avoid running out of RAM), but the implementation was buggy and complex. So we reverted to holding all predictions for a scene in RAM, and now assume that scenes are roughly < 20,000 x 20,000 pixels. This works better anyway from a parallelization standponit.
* We switched to writing chips to disk incrementally during the ``CHIP`` command using a ``SampleWriter`` class to avoid running out of RAM.
* The term "predict package" has been replaced with "model bundle", since it rolls off the tongue better, and ``BUNDLE`` is the name of the command that produces it.
* Class ids are now indexed starting at 0 instead of 1, which seems more intuitive. The "null class", used for marking pixels in semantic segmentation that have not been labeled, used to be 0, and is now equal to ``len(class_ids)``.
* The ``aws_batch`` runner was renamed ``batch`` due to a naming conflict, and the names of the configuration variables for Batch changed. See :ref:`aws batch setup`.

Future Work
~~~~~~~~~~~

The next big features we plan on developing are:

* the ability to read and write data in `STAC <https://stacspec.org/>`__ format using the `label extension <https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/tree/master/extensions/label>`__. This will facilitate integration with other tools such as `GroundWork <https://groundwork.azavea.com/>`__.

Notes on switching to PyTorch-based backends
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The current backends based on Tensorflow have several problems:

* They depend on third party libraries (Deeplab, TF Object Detection API) that are complex, not well suited to being used as dependencies within a larger project, and are each written in a different style. This makes the code for each backend very different from one other, and unnecessarily complex. This increases the maintenance burden, makes it difficult to customize, and makes it more difficult to implement a consistent set of functionality between the backends.
* Tensorflow, in the maintainer's opinion, is more difficult to write and debug than PyTorch (although this is starting to improve).
* The third party libraries assume that training images are stored as PNG or JPG files. This limits our ability to handle more than three bands and more that 8-bits per channel. We have recently completed some research on how to train models on > 3 bands, and we plan on adding this functionality to Raster Vision.

Therefore, we are in the process of sunsetting the Tensorflow backends (which will probably be removed) and have implemented replacement PyTorch-based backends. The main things to be aware of in upgrading to this version of Raster Vision are as follows:

* Instead of there being CPU and GPU Docker images (based on Tensorflow), there are now tf-cpu, tf-gpu, and pytorch (which works on both CPU and GPU) images. Using ``./docker/build --tf`` or ``./docker/build --pytorch`` will only build the TF or PyTorch images, respectively.
* Using the TF backends requires being in the TF container, and similar for PyTorch. There are now ``--tf-cpu``, ``--tf-gpu``, and ``--pytorch-gpu`` options for the ``./docker/run`` command. The default setting is to use the PyTorch image in the standard (CPU) Docker runtime.
* The `raster-vision-aws <https://github.com/azavea/raster-vision-aws>`__ CloudFormation setup creates Batch resources for TF-CPU, TF-GPU, and PyTorch. It also now uses default AMIs provided by AWS, simplifying the setup process.
* To easily switch between running TF and PyTorch jobs on Batch, we recommend creating two separate Raster Vision profiles with the Batch resources for each of them.
* The way to use the ``ConfigBuilders`` for the new backends can be seen in the `examples repo <https://github.com/azavea/raster-vision-examples>`__ and the :ref:`backend` reference
