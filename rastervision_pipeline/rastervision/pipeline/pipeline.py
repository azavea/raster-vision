    This is an abstraction over a sequence of commands. Each command is

    Note that any split command methods should have the following signature:
    def my_command(self, split_ind: int = 0, num_splits: int = 1)
    The num_splits represents how many parallel jobs should be created, and
    the split_ind is the index of the current job within that set.

        commands: command names listed in the order in which they should run
        split_commands: names of commands that can be split and run in parallel
        gpu_commands: names of commands that should be executed on GPUs if
